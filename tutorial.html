				<h4><a id="part1"></a>Part 1: Reasons for studying</h4>
			</header>

			<p>
				Your reasons for studying should be able to help massively in motivating you to start and continue to do work. By being able 
				to remember the reasaons to study such as the future you can have by doing well. Talking to friends and family about your future
				within that subject could improve your level of excitement and the want to do well can increase massively. So by having a lot 
				of conversations about studying and the future you can have by studying well and consistently can improve your motivation to do so. 
				This allows for your reasons to study to be increased and the want to do study will go up so that it can mean you are starting to 
				independant learn already.

				<h4><a id="part2"></a>Part 2: Understanding your strengths</h4>
			</header>

			<p>
				The importance of understanding your strengths before and while you are studying so that you know which parts to study first.
				You would have learnt which parts you know well and these can be noted down quickly and easily. There are many ways for you to note down 
				skills in which you are confident with such as these three:
			</p>
				
			<ol>
				<li>Mind map method</li>
				<li>The Cornell method</li>
				<li>The sentence method</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				Now in the modern day many people prefer having everything online in the modern day so there is other ways to note your strengths down,
				such as these study help apps:
			</p>

			<ol>

				<h4><a id="part3"></a>Part 3: Creating a study schedule</h4>
			</header>

			<p>
				Study schedule can change the game of indiviual learning as good ones create an objective for you to hit that is 
				achievable while bringing you closer to your goal. The best study schedule's are those that include everything for your
				day that is needed. For example: classes, socialising, studying and sleep.
				A well complete study schedule could be the difference between a good well balanced happy time at uni and a bad stressful
				time.

				<h4><a id="part4"></a>Part 4: Useful tips</h4>
			</header>

			<p>
				Tips are different for anyone so you should try them and see which ones work well for you to include into your daily life 
				so that you can improve your studying ability, motivation as well as concentracion. These are the ones that have worked the best for me 
				from my personal experience:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Physical activity, sitting for long periods can demotivate you</li>
				<li>Be strategic, doing the hardest parts while you have the most motivation</li>
				<li>Incentives, extra motivation for parts for those that you struggle the most with</li>
				<li>Take in information and organise it, create a plan for the study session or for the week</li>
				<li>Reflect, learn from how each study session has gone and how they can be improved so that they are as efficent as possible</li>
			</ol>
